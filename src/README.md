**Do not edit fonts outside the `1-drawings` directory, they are intermediate build artifacts generated by the build script**

`1-drawings` contains the 'true' sources, in UFO format.

`build.py` then takes them and builds the variable font, outputting the instance UFOs in `master_ufo` and `instances` 

Those are build into TTFs using [fontmake](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake) which stores intermediate binaries in `master\_ttf\_interpolatable` and `master\_ttf`

These build intermediates are checked in to keep a full historical record, as they are used for debugging purposes.

The actual TTF you should use is in `/fonts`
