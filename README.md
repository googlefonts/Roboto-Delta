# Roboto-Delta

A demo version of Roboto as a parametric variable font.

Roboto became a flagship Google brand typeface in 2011.
It is prominently positioned in the global design community, with Google using it in most UIs and for branded content at small sizes.
It is the default face of the Material Design Specification.
Available publicly as open source, it is featured in more than 11M websites and is #2 on Google Fonts.

In 2016 the OpenType format was updated to support Apple's “GX” run-time interpolation technology.
The primary motivation for Adobe, Apple, Google and Microsoft to do this was obtaining dramatic reductions in the file-size of large font families, such as Google's Noto fonts. 
The Google Fonts team intends to go beyond compression, to make Variable Fonts meaningful.

The technology offers potential for new ways to do typography, and can improve Material Specification Typography guidance in myriad ways.
Today the Material spec has fiddly settings for tracking and weights, used to approximate good typographic colors and textures.
But the new OpenType technology means these settings can be built-in to “just work.” 

After the public announcement of the technology in fall 2016, the Google Fonts team commissioned Font Bureau to develop a pilot project, Amstelvar, that demonstrates a novel approach in a system of inter-related axes. 
This enables file-size reduction while increasing the fine typographic control available to typographers;
it enables a new kind of “parametric” typography.

Applying this approach to Google’s primary text typeface, we hope to socialize the benefits of this novel approach across the design community.

This project was commissioned by Google, but is not an official Google project, and Google provides no support for it.
